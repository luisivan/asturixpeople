# Asturix People
### The next hit of the Asturix project

Asturix People is a direct democracy system. You take the decision

All the users can submit proposals (called ideas) that can be voted (up/down/abstention)

When an idea has a big karma it is approved and the project leaders/company direction/president have to carry it out

Asturix People uses HTML5, CSS3, jQuery, PHP, MySQL... it is 100% AJAX

## The target

The target is to create geographic located communities using Asturix People and send a monthly email to the political parties of that state or nation to listen to popular requests.
