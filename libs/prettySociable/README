============================== Description ===============================

prettySociable is a jQuery plugin that tries to make sharing fun while
being easy to use. It was inspired by the sharing on mashable.com.

While ShareThis and AddThis provides a very useful piece code that allow
users to share basically anything everywhere, their solution is not the
prettiest nor the easiest to use. prettySociable simply asks the user to
drag the items he wants to share onto the website he wants to send it to.

Please refer to http://www.no-margin-for-errors.com/projects/prettySociable/
for all the details on how to use.
